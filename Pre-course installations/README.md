## Install Required Software

Before we begin our workshop, we would like everyone to have Python 3 installed on their laptops so that they can follow along in class. We will be using Miniconda, which includes Python 3, along with an easy system for installing Python packages.

We will also need a text editor to create and edit Python script files. We will be using Sublime Text 3 as the text editor that we will be demonstrating with in class.
