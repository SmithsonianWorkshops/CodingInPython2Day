Fortunately, this is pretty easy in Python. Say you want to read some sequence data in seqs.fasta. You can open the file and assign the whole file to a variable with the `open()` command."

This method  places each line as an entry into a list. This allows you to use any function that you might use with a list. Let's use that method now and print out the lines that we read using a for loop, then close the file using `close()`."
